Notes On AWS Deployment

To Create RDS Instance:
1. Create a group and group policies (for example, we need EC2 Full Access and RDS Full Access)
2. Create user and add the user to the group. When a user is created, AWS will give you an “Access Key ID” and a “Secret Access Key” in a csv. file)
3. Make sure you’re in the correct location/region in AWS.
4. Create an RDS instance, selecting PostgreSQL and check the box of “Free tier only”.
5. In “Specify DB details”, you will see that the “DB instance class” shows t2.micro; t2.micro is one of the smallest unit of AWS RDS.
6. In “Configure advanced settings”, “Public accessibility”, choose “Yes”.
7. “In VPC security groups”, choose “Create new VPC security group”. A VPC security group is where we set the in-bound and out-bound rules.
8. In “Performance Insights”, choose “Disable Performance Insights”.
9. In “Log exports”, check “Postgresql log” and “Upgrade log”.
10. Uncheck “Enable deletion protection”, and then “Create database”.
